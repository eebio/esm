This means that uploading a .esm file a supplementary data for an article allows anyone to view the raw data and see (and reproduce) exactly how it was processed to derive the results seen in the article.\n\nSince we have all the data in a standardised format, we can (and do) provide a set of methods for processing the data. This includes calibration methods, flow cytometry gating, and calculating summary statistics such as growth rate or per cell fluorescence. While we provide many possible methods for each of these, we also offer sensible, robust, benchmark-verified defaults that should work in the majority of cases.\n\nESM can be used either as a Julia package, or more typically, through its command line interface. If you want to learn how to use ESM, check out the documentation.\n\nContributing\n\nThere are a couple of ways you can contribute towards ESM.\n\nIf you have a method that you would like to see included in ESM, please open a new issue,\nIf you have a plate reader machine that isn't currently supported (see the docs for current compatability), please open a new issue,\nIf you find a bug or mistake in the documentation, please open a new issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"tutorial/#Getting-Started-with-ESM","page":"Getting Started with ESM","title":"Getting Started with ESM","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"tutorial/","page":"Getting Started with ESM","title":"Getting Started with ESM","text":"This tutorial will walk you through the complete workflow of processing experimental data with ESM, from initial data exploration to final visualization.
